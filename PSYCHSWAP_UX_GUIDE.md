# PsychSwap UX Design Guide

## 🎯 **Design Philosophy: Credibility Over Entertainment**

### **Core Principle**
PsychSwap positions itself as a **psychological assessment tool** for DeFi, not a personality quiz. Every element should reinforce that this is a data-driven, research-backed decision support system.

## 📝 **Welcome Message Strategy**

### **Two-Sentence Welcome Copy**
> "Your analytical approach to risk and preference for balanced time horizons suggests you thrive on strategic, well-researched opportunities. We've curated three swap strategies that align with your cognitive profile and risk tolerance patterns."

### **Why This Works:**
- **Professional tone** - Uses psychological terminology
- **Data-backed language** - "suggests", "cognitive profile", "risk tolerance patterns"
- **Specific and actionable** - Mentions concrete strategies
- **Confidence-building** - Implies deep analysis was performed

## 🎨 **Swap Suggestions UX Layout**

### **Card-Based Design with Selection States**

#### **Visual Hierarchy:**
1. **Token Pair** (prominent, large font)
2. **Strategy Type** (secondary, smaller)
3. **Risk/Holding badges** (color-coded)
4. **Explanation** (detailed rationale)
5. **Action button** (contextual based on selection)

#### **Interaction States:**
- **Default**: Subtle border, gray button
- **Selected**: Purple border, gradient button
- **Hover**: Enhanced shadow, smooth transitions

#### **Credibility Elements:**
- **Confidence percentage** for each suggestion
- **Data visualization** of user's traits
- **Professional icons** (not emoji)
- **Consistent color coding** (green=low risk, yellow=medium, red=high)

## 🔄 **Override Section Design**

### **Copy Strategy:**
**Primary**: "Forge Your Own Path"
**Secondary**: "While our analysis suggests these strategies align with your profile, you're always in control. Explore the full DeFi ecosystem on your own terms."

### **Visual Design:**
- **Orange/red gradient** (different from main purple/blue theme)
- **Lightning bolt icon** (suggests power/independence)
- **Warning message** when activated
- **Positioned as secondary option** (not competing with main suggestions)

### **UX Flow:**
1. User sees curated suggestions first
2. Override appears as "alternative path"
3. Warning message reinforces the value of the analysis
4. Clear exit to full trading interface

## 🎨 **Copywriting Tone Guide**

### **Primary Tone: Professional Psychologist**
- **Confident but humble** - "suggests" not "proves"
- **Data-driven** - Use specific percentages and metrics
- **Educational** - Explain why recommendations make sense
- **Respectful** - Acknowledge user's autonomy

### **Secondary Tone: Financial Advisor**
- **Risk-aware** - Always mention risk considerations
- **Educational** - Explain DeFi concepts clearly
- **Transparent** - Show methodology and limitations
- **Supportive** - Guide without being pushy

### **Avoid:**
- Buzzfeed-style language ("You won't BELIEVE what your personality says about your trading!")
- Overly casual tone
- Absolute statements ("This IS your perfect strategy")
- Gimmicky language

### **Embrace:**
- Conditional language ("suggests", "indicates", "aligns with")
- Data references ("Based on your 87% analytical depth...")
- Educational content ("This strategy works well for users with similar risk tolerance patterns")
- Professional humility ("While our analysis suggests...")
